        abstract = {Pro-cycling interventions, and cycle hire schemes in particular, are often assumed to primarily benefit the privileged. This framing has played-out in academic research, with many papers exploring the relationship between cycling and existing inequalities. A growing body of evidence suggests that cycle hire schemes tend to serve wealthy areas and young, high income groups, mirroring inequalities in other types of cycling uptake, yet there has been little research into the ?direction of travel? and whether such inequalities are growing or ?levelling up? over time. This paper explores the uptake of the London Cycle Hire Scheme (LCHS), a large, early and prominent scheme that had the explicit aim of ?normalising? cycling. The method involved reproducible analysis (with code documented in the GitHub repo Robinlovelace/cycle-hire-inclusive) of 73.4 million cycle high records spanning 8 years from January 2012 to December 2019, using the geographic location of docking stations alongside official statistics to assess social and spatial inequalities in uptake.

The method involved analysis of 73.4 million cycle high records spanning 8 years from January 2012 to December 2019, using the geographic location of docking stations alongside official statistics to assess social and spatial inequalities in uptake. We found that, contrary to the trend for increasing segregation and geographic inequalities, the usage of the LCHS have become increasingly geographically distributed across London over time, with AM peak usage in comparatively low-income areas seeing high levels of growth. Our study shows that cycle hire schemes can be designed and expanded in ways that benefit a wide range of people, including those from low income areas, and that new cycle hire docking stations in poorer areas can succeed.}

abstract = {The implementation of bicycle sharing schemes represents an important innovation in urban public transport since the turn of the millennium. These schemes have spread rapidly and are now present in cities with varying economic, environmental, and structural conditions. Developing strategies through which to attract new members to join the scheme and retain existing members is a fundamental requirement for scheme success. The research reported in this paper provides guidance on this issue through a case study appraisal of the experiences that existing members have with the London Bicycle Sharing Scheme. This appraisal focuses on how the quality of service is perceived by members, their overall level of satisfaction with the scheme, their behavioural intentions toward renewing their memberships, and their willingness to recommend the scheme to others. A market segmentation analysis is produced which identifies the presence of four heterogeneous member groups. These member segments are profiled according to their demographic, psychographic, and behavioural characteristics. Through a detailed appreciation of the defining features of these member segments, strategies are proposed which are tailored to their specific needs and expectations.}

    abstract = { In recent years, bikeshare systems have spread throughout the United States. Despite the increase in systems and users, little is known about how bikeshare member demographics and travel patterns compare with those of traditional bicyclists. To bridge the gap, this study investigated bikeshare system user travel behavior and developed a profile of user demographics through the comparison of short-term (1 day) users and annual members of Capital Bikeshare (CaBi) in Washington, D.C., with profiles of area bicyclists. Data originated from a Washington, D.C., regional household travel survey of 2007–2008, an intercept survey of short-term CaBi users, and an online survey of annual CaBi members. The analysis compared gender, race and ethnicity, age, and student status, as well as socioeconomic status across the surveys. The comparison included trip purpose, helmet use, and travel modes for trips that were replaced by bikesharing. Profiles of CaBi and area cyclists differed with respect to many demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Compared with area cyclists, CaBi short-term users and annual members were more likely to be female and younger, to have lower household incomes, and to own fewer cars and fewer bicycles and were more likely to cycle for utilitarian purposes. CaBi trips mainly replaced trips made by public transport and by walking. CaBi short-term users and members shared similar characteristics, but short-term users were more likely to ride for recreational purposes and were less likely to wear a helmet. The study results indicated that bikesharing can encourage new segments of society to cycle and can help increase the bicycling mode share overall. }
